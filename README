GParted stands for Gnome Partition Editor.

It uses libparted to detect and manipulate devices and partition
tables while several (optional) file system tools provide support for
filesystems not included in libparted.  These optional packages will
be detected at runtime and don't require a rebuild of GParted.

GParted is written in C++ and uses gtkmm as Graphical Toolkit.  The
general approach is to keep the GUI as simple as possible.  That's why
I try to conform to the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines.
