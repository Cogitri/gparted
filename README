GPARTED
-------
Gparted is the Gnome Partition Editor for creating, reorganizing, and
deleting disk partitions.

A hard disk is usually subdivided into one or more partitions.  These
partitions are normally not re-sizable (making one smaller and the
adjacent one larger.)  Gparted makes it possible for you to take a
hard disk and change the partition organization, while preserving the
partition contents.

More specifically, Gparted enables you to create, destroy, resize,
move, check, label, and copy partitions, and the file systems
contained within.  This is useful for creating space for new operating
systems, reorganizing disk usage, and mirroring one partition with
another (disk imaging).

Gparted uses GNU libparted to detect and manipulate devices and
partition tables.  Several optional packages provide additional file
system support.  Optional packages include:
   e2fsprogs, dosfstools, mtools, hfsutils, jfsutils,
   ntfsprogs, reiser4progs, reiserfsprogs, and xfsprogs.

Gparted can also be used with storage devices other than hard disks,
such as USB flash drives, and memory cards.
