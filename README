GPARTED
-------
Gparted is the Gnome Partition Editor for creating, reorganizing, and
deleting disk partitions.

A hard disk is usually subdivided into one or more partitions.  These
partitions are normally not re-sizable (making one smaller and the
adjacent one larger.)  Gparted makes it possible for you to take a
hard disk and change the partition organization, while preserving the
partition contents.

More specifically, Gparted enables you to create, destroy, resize,
move, check, label, and copy partitions, and the file systems
contained within.  This is useful for creating space for new operating
systems, reorganizing disk usage, and mirroring one partition with
another (disk imaging).

Gparted can also be used with storage devices other than hard disks,
such as USB flash drives, and memory cards.

INSTALL
-------
a. Pre-built Binary

   Many GNU/Linux distributions already provide a pre-built binary
   package for GParted.  Instructions on how to install GParted on
   some distributions is given below:

      (K)Ubuntu
      ---------
      sudo apt-get install gparted

      Fedora
      ------
      su -
      yum install gparted

b. Building from Source

   Building Gparted from source requires that several dependencies are
   installed.  These include:
      g++
      e2fsprogs
      parted
      gtkmm24
      gettext
      gnome-doc-utils     - required if help documentation is to be built

   On (K)Ubuntu, these dependencies may be obtained by running the
   following command;
      sudo apt-get install build-essential e2fsprogs uuid uuid-dev \
                           gnome-common libparted-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev \
                           libdevmapper-dev

   On Fedora, you will need to run (as root);
      yum install gtkmm24-devel parted-devel e2fsprogs-devel gettext \
                  perl(XML::Parser) desktop-file-utils

   Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
   configure, build, and install this package.  If you wish to build
   this package without the help documentation use the --disable-doc
   flag:
      E.g., ./configure --disable doc
 
   The INSTALL file contains further GNU installation instructions.

DISTRIBUTION NOTES
------------------
Gparted uses GNU libparted to detect and manipulate devices and partition
tables.  Several optional packages provide additional file system support.
Optional packages include:

   e2fsprogs
   dosfstools
   mtools          - required to read and write FAT16/32 volume labels
   hfsutils
   hfsprogs
   jfsutils
   ntfsprogs
   reiser4progs
   reiserfsprogs
   xfsprogs

   NOTE:  * If the vol_id command is in the search PATH, it will be used
            to read linux-swap, reiser4, hfs, and hfs+ file system
            volume labels.
          * If the blkid command is in the search path, it will be used
            to read file system UUIDs and labels. 
            blkid is part of the e2fsprogs package.
