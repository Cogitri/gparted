GParted stands for Gnome Partition Editor and is a graphical frontend to libparted. Among other features it supports creating, resizing, moving and copying of partitions.

The first goal of GParted is to provide all libparted's features as outlined at http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/#features.
When this is done and GParted is stable enough for normal use, i will look into support for other filesystems such as ntfs .

GParted is written in C++ and uses gtkmm as Graphical Toolkit. The general approach is to keep the GUI as simple as possible. That's why i try to conform to the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines .
