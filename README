GPARTED
-------

GParted stands for Gnome Partition Editor.

It uses libparted to detect and manipulate devices and partition
tables while several (optional) file system tools provide support for
file systems not included in libparted.  These optional packages will
be detected at runtime and don't require a rebuild of GParted.

GParted is written in C++ and uses gtkmm as Graphical Toolkit.  The
general approach is to keep the GUI as simple as possible.  That's why
we try to conform to the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines.

INSTALL NOTES
-------------

Compiling GParted requires that several dependencies are installed.

Following are instructions on how to install these dependencies (which
may install other dependencies) on two different GNU/Linux
distributions:

   (k)ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon
   ---------------------------

   sudo apt-get install build-essential e2fsprogs uuid uuid-dev \
                        gnome-common libparted-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev


   Fedora 8
   --------

   su -
   yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
   yum install perl-XML-DOM.noarch e2fsprogs-devel parted-devel \
               gnome-common gtkmm24-devel


Compiling and installing GParted is performed using the standard 
steps of:

   ./configure
   make
   make install


For more information on installation instructions, refer to the
file named INSTALL.



DISTRIBUTION NOTES
------------------

GParted uses GNU libparted to detect and manipulate devices and
partition tables.

Several optional packages provide additional file system support.
Optional packages that should be listed include:

   e2fsprogs
   dosfstools
   mtools
   hfsutils
   jfsutils
   ntfsprogs
   reiser4progs
   reiserfsprogs
   xfsprogs

If the vol_id command is in the search PATH, it will be used to read
linux-swap volume labels.

Note to packagers:  The above optional packages are not mandatory for
                    gparted operation, and should probably listed
                    as 'suggests' not 'depends on'.
