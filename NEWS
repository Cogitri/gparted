====================
0.4.1   (2008-11-29)
====================
NOTES
	This release of GParted rolls back /dev/mapper/* detection.
	
	The problem was that all /dev/mapper/* entries were added to the
	device list including LVM partitions.  This was confusing behaviour
	to GParted users, and in my opinion it was better to roll back
	this change.

	A work-around for /dev/mapper/* device detection is available by
	passing the device names to gparted on the command line.
	E.g.,
	     gparted /dev/mapper/device-name

	Thanks to François Dupoux for identifying this problem early, and
	working towards a resolution.

BUG FIXES
	* Reopened bug - no longer sees /dev/mapper/* devices (#556114)

TRANSLATIONS (new/updated)
	* no change.

DEPENDENCIES (new/updated)
	* no change.
