============================
GParted 0.9.0   (2011-07-18)
============================

Release Notes
-------------
  The most significant change in this release is the ability to
  compile and link with libparted 3.0.

  GParted retains full functionality when compiled and linked with
  libparted versions prior to 3.0, for example libparted-2.4.

  Because Parted 3.0 removed some file system specific functionality,
  the following abilities are lost or changed when GParted is compiled
  and linked with libparted 3.0:

    * Unable to grow and shrink FAT16 and FAT32 file systems
    * Unable to shrink HFS and HFS+ file systems
    * Unable to determine used and unused sectors in HFS and HFS+ file
      systems
    * Unable to erase file system signatures on partition create and
      format
    * FAT16 and FAT32 file system moves performed internally by
      GParted instead of by libparted

### Other key changes include:

  * Fix size off by one sector with unrecognized disk label
  * Fix GParted crashes with assertion (head_size <= 63)
    - Requires libparted-2.4 or higher

Bug Fixes
---------
  * Enable compile and link with libparted 3.0 (#651559)
  * Fix size off by one sector with unrecognized disk label (#649444)
  * Fix GParted crashes with assertion (head_size <= 63)
    - Requires libparted-2.4 or higher
    - Ubuntu launchpad #545911
  * Fix typo "on on " -> "on" (#650793)
    - Thanks go to Gabor Kelemen for this small patch
  * Improve English grammar: amount -> number (#650237)

0.6.1   (2010-07-08)
====================
NOTES
	This is an important bug fix release for two critical bugs
	found in GParted.  Also included are some language translation
	updates.

	Key changes include:
	  - Fix crash moving partition when size is a multiple of 16 MiB
	  - Disable MiB alignment temporarily until bug #623630 can be fixed.

	    Bug #623630 is a problem where moving logical partitions using
	    the new MiB alignment feature might overwrite the Extended Boot
	    Record of another logical partition.  This causes an invalid
	    partition table with a wrong signature.

BUG FIXES
	* Fix crash moving partition when size is a multiple of 16 MiB (#623697)
	* Disable MiB alignment temporarily until bug #623630 can be fixed.

====================
0.6.0   (2010-06-18)
====================
NOTES
	The GParted team is proud to announce this release brings
	support for devices with sector sizes greater than 512 bytes.

	For the last three decades, 512 byte sector sizes have been
	the norm and many tools, including GParted, were hard coded to
	assume this sector size.

	Also included in this release are bug fixes, and language
	translation updates.

	Key changes include:
	  - Add support for devices with sector sizes > 512 bytes
	  - Add alignment option to align to MiB
	  - Set _default_ alignment to align to MiB

	Known issues:
	  When used with libparted versions 2.3 and lower on devices with
	  sector sizes > 512 bytes:
	  - hfs/hfs+: used/unused space not detected
	  - hfs/hfs+: shrink file system not available

BUG FIXES
	* Add support for devices with sector sizes > 512 bytes (#607165)
	* Add align to MiB option and make it the default (#617409)
	* Enable copy to work on computers with only 128 MiB RAM (#613430)
	* Fix mkswap error "UUID parsing failed" when resizing with no UUID
	  - Debian Bug #573836
	* Handle devkit-disks command being renamed to udisks on Dec. 2009
	  - GParted Bug #324220 comment 62, Ubuntu launchpad #588530

DEPENDENCIES (new/updated)

	  version 2.2 or higher.
	* Previously missed dependency for DMRAID:
	  - if available, either udevinfo or udevadm will be used
	    to query the udev name.

====================
0.4.1   (2008-11-29)
====================
NOTES
	This release of GParted rolls back /dev/mapper/* detection.
	
	The problem was that all /dev/mapper/* entries were added to the
	device list including LVM partitions.  This was confusing behaviour
	to GParted users, and in my opinion it was better to roll back
	this change.

	A work-around for /dev/mapper/* device detection is available by
	passing the device names to gparted on the command line.
	E.g.,
	     gparted /dev/mapper/device-name

	Thanks to François Dupoux for identifying this problem early, and
	working towards a resolution.

BUG FIXES
	* Reopened bug - no longer sees /dev/mapper/* devices (#556114)

TRANSLATIONS (new/updated)
	* no change.

DEPENDENCIES (new/updated)
	* no change.
