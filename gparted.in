#  Purpose:  Acquire device locks prior to running gparted.
#            This is to prevent devices from being automounted.
#            File system problems can occur if devices are mounted
#            prior to the completion of GParted's operations.
#            See GParted bug #324220

#  Following is a quote from HAL 0.5.10 Specification.
#  http://people.freedesktop.org/~david/hal-spec/hal-spec.html#locking-guidelines
#
#  In order to prevent HAL-based automounters from mounting partitions
#  that are being prepared, applications that access block devices
#  directly (and pokes the kernel to reload the partitioning table)
#  should lock out automounters by either a) obtaining the
#  org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.Storage lock on each drive being processed;
#  or b) obtaining the global org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.Storage lock.
#

hal-lock --interface org.freedeskdesktop.Hal.Device.Storage --exclusive \
	--run @installdir@/gpartedbin $*
