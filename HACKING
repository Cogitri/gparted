git guidelines for gparted
==========================

Please do not commit directly to the git.gnome.org/gparted repository
unless you have been given the green light to commit freely to
gparted.  When in doubt assume you haven't ;-).

If you are a translator feel free to mark strings for translation, fix
typos in the code, etc.  I'd appreciate it if you would notify me of
anything you've done.

Please send patches for build & configure fixes too.  I really appreciate
your help, I just want to review these fixes before applying.

!!WHENEVER YOU COMMIT, PLACE A COMMENT IN GIT!!
even when it's only one character. =)

Thanks,
Curtis
