**changes**
- replaced some 'dunglish' terms with more decent english. (Thanks to Tino Meinen)
- cleaned up autoconf stuff a bit
- gparted now gets installed in the sbin/ instead of bin/ (1023181)
- maximum amount of primary partition isn't static anymore, it gets asked from the partition table.
- lots of internal code cleanups. this improved performance and stability.
- doubleclick now invokes infodialog
- added .desktop file so gparted is accessible from Gnome/Kde menus (thanks to Stephane LOEUILLET, 1023176)

**fixes**
- sometimes creating new fat filesystems in very small spaces resulted in errors. fixed.
- use copies from buildfiles instead of symlinks to them. (Thanks to Kristof Vansant)
- when performing operations on just copied partitions, there was a chance the operation would be executed on another partition. fixed.
- fixed a rare bug that caused incorrect partitiontable display after an operation went wrong.
- some errormessages were not entirely threadsafe, fixed (hopefully :P )
- fixed annoying bug with warningdialog which pops up after performing an operation on a busy device
