2004-11-29 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* src/GParted_Core.cc: It seemed some kernels remove and re-add blockdevicepaths after the commit_to_os. This caused trouble at some points
	  where the path was required. I decided to sleep 1 sec after each scan. So rescanning devices will take 1 extra second per device :|
	* src/Win_GParted.cc: fixed typo in string.

2004-11-29 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* Every devicescan now tests on beforehand if the kernel is able to reread the partitiontable. If the kernel is unable to do
	  this, i disallow most operations. This may seem weird and even a bad thing to do, but the fact is it protects
	  the innocent user from a lot of potential damage. Till the linuxkernel is able to reread partitiontables no matter what, this seems
	  to be the best option. Of course a dialog with information will popup whenever such a situation is encountered.
	  In a next release i might consider adding an 'advanced mode' for users who know what they're doing.

2004-11-28  Alessio Frusciante  <algol@firenze.linux.it>

	* configure.in: Added "it" (Italian) to ALL_LINGUAS. 

2004-11-28 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* src/Dialog_Partition_New.cc: selecting 'extended partition' twice caused a segfault. i cannot believe i didn't detect this bug earlier :| Fixed.
	  also made it possible to create an unformatted partition.
	* src/GParted_Core.cc: backend support for creating partition without filesystem (unformatted).

2004-11-28 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* src/Dialog_Disklabel.cc,
	  src/GParted_Core.cc: minor stringchanges (typos)

2004-11-28 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* src/Makefile.am: sorted sourcefiles alphabetically, i know, pretty useless, but i like it :P

2004-11-28 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* Harddisks without disklabel are now properly initizalized and shown in the menu. When one tries to create a new partition on
	  such a disk a dialog pops up with some blabla about disklabels and offers to create a disklabel. sweet :P (special thanks to mantiena-baltix 
	  for bringing this issue to my attention)
	* fixed minor annoyance with refreshing detailed deviceinfo after a 'deep refresh'

2004-11-24 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* src/Dialog_Partition_Resize_Move.cc: fixed small bug with resizing and lower limits.
	* src/GParted_Core.cc: use ped_file_system_clobber before creating a filesystem on a partition.
	* src/Win_GParted.cc: pasting is now only allowed if unallocated >= copied partition + cylindersize.
	  Instead of dividing length device by amount of cylinders i use heads * sectors/track to get cylindersize.
	  Changed device busy warning a bit to more decent english (adamw)
	* src/ntfs.cc: readded '-Q' to mkntfs. The error about an 'unknown filesystem' was related to detection problems and not to
	  faulty creation of the filesystem. Should be solved anyway by implementing ped_file_system_clobber.
	  Also removed ntfsfix since it didn't do anything relevant. Instead i use ntfsresize, because this contains relevant checks (szaka)

2004-11-24 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* src/TreeView_Detail.cc: renamed columnheader from 'Type' to 'Filesystem'. Dunno why it was called 'Type' (maybe some PM legacy =)  )
	* src/Win_GParted.cc: Made device busy warning a bit more sensible.

2004-11-24 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* include/Utils.h,
	  src/GParted_Core.cc,
	  src/Partition.cc,
	  src/TreeView_Detail.cc,
	  src/VBox_VisualDisk.cc: marked some strings for translation ('unknown', 'used', 'unused') and replaced lowercase 'unallocated' with '---'.

2004-11-24 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* include/GParted_Core.h,
	  src/GParted_Core.cc: fixed nasty error with resizing 'fixed-start filesystems'.
	* src/Partition.cc: added a check to prevent unused space from being bigger then total space.
	* src/ntfs.cc: removed -Q from mkntfs. -Q bypassed some safetychecks to gain performance and (so i heard later) also had a
	  tendency of failing ;) (Adrighem)

2004-11-23 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* src/Dialog_Partition_New.cc,
	  src/Win_GParted.cc: Fixed some errors with 'unknown' filesystem. + some cosmetics

2004-11-23 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* include/GParted_Core.h,
	  src/GParted_Core.cc,
	  src/Makefile.am,
	  include/ntfs.h,
	  src/ntfs.cc: added full ntfs support. (couldn't test it very well due to the absence of a win32 box :P )

2004-11-22 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* include/Utils.h: fixed crasher with unknown filesystems.

2004-11-22 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* src/GParted_Core.cc: cosmetics
	* src/reiserfs.cc: make use of real commands instead of their symlinks. fixed copy of reiserfs filsystem
	  (the new size wasn't reported correctly)

2004-11-22 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* src/ext2.cc,
	  src/ext3.cc: removed ':' from Blocksize scan.
	* src/reiserfs.cc: dumped progsreiserfs. From now on gparted uses the official namesystools (reiserfsprogs)
	  this resulted in much more reliable creation en resizing of reiserfs filesystems.

2004-11-21 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* Again way too many chances to create a detailed entry (i'm glad i'm the only dev atm :P ).
	  Resizing of ext2/3 works perfect now. I've even tested it on the partition holding my SG seasons =)
	  Implemented checking of filesystems (only internally used atm).
	  Done some overall tweaking, finetuning etc.. release 0.0.7 is getting shape.

2004-11-19 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* include/Device.h,
	  src/Device.cc: Removed bool Get_Any_Busy() in favor of public bool busy which is set in gparted_core.
	  This also fixed a small bug with incorrect mountdetection of logical partitions.
	  Also added a Reset() function to properly reset the contents of a device. to zero/empty .
	* include/GParted_Core.h,
	  src/GParted_Core.cc: 'busyness' of a device is now determined in get_devices().
	  Renamed get_partitions() to set_device_partitions to reflect its proper function.
	  When a new partition is created to contain a copied filesystem the size is now properly set. This fixes
	  a very annoying bug which no one knew about except for me =) .
	* src/Win_GParted.cc: use boolean busy from device instead of Get_Any_Busy() .

2004-11-17 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* src/ext3.cc: availability of 'tune2fs' command wasn't detected correctly. fixed
	* src/fat32.cc: make use of dosfs tools (mkdosfs -F32) instead of libparted's Fat-creator.
	
2004-11-17 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* Rewrote a large part of gparteds internal code. Filesystemssupport is now much more separated from the rest of gparted and
	  adding support for other filesystems should be a piece of cake now (hope that's true :P)
	  It still needs a lot of love, but the foundations are laid =)

2004-11-07 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* include/Operation.h,
	  src/Operation.cc: make use of reference arguments instead of return values in some functions.
	  Also fixed a small bug with deletion of a virtual (new) logical partition.
	* include/VBox_VisualDisk.h,
	  src/VBox_VisualDisk.cc: logical filesystems weren't shown in the legend, fixed.
	* src/Frame_Resizer_Base.cc: fixed small bug with custom cursors.
	* src/TreeView_Detail.cc: removed obsolete, already commented code.
	* src/Win_GParted.cc: make use of reference arguments instead of return values in some functions. (see Operation)

2004-11-06 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* include/Win_GParted.h,
	  src/Win_GParted.cc: added umount option. Also include unistd.h to solve some issues with gcc 3.2.x

2004-11-06 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* instead of listing all partition in one list, logical partitions are now stored in a sublist in extended partition object.
	This makes partitionhandling in gparted more natural and transparant. It also allowed me to clean up this ugly Operation class ;)

2004-10-31 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* include/Partition.h,
	  src/Partition.cc: removed color_string
	* src/VBox_VisualDisk.cc,
	  src/TreeView_Detail.cc: replaced color_string with Get_Color from Utils.h

2004-10-30 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* configure.in: added checks for libuuid and libdl. Also refined libparted check a bit.
	* include/Partition.h,
	  src/Partition.cc: removed Get_Color()
	* include/Utils.h: added inline Glib::ustring Get_Color( const Glib::ustring & filesystem )
	* src/Dialog_Partition_New.cc,
	  src/Win_GParted.cc: make use of Get_Color from Utils.h
	* src/Device.cc: fixed a crasher with (at least) pl_PL locale.

2004-10-25 Vincent van Adrighem  <adrighem@gnome.org>

	* debian/*: Added a debian subdir. This dir contains buildscripts
	    for debian.

2004-10-22 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* configure.in: bumped to version 0.0.6

2004-10-22 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* configure.in: libpartedcheck now looks for correct version number (finally i'll be rid off those stupid bugreports =) )

2004-10-22 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* src/Dialog_Partition_Info.cc: codecleanups.. Hey! i was bored :P

2004-10-22 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* src/Device.cc: removed libparted messagesdialog. instead, show them on the console. They proved to be pretty useless.
	* src/Win_GParted.cc: fixed crasher when loading gparted (or refresh devices) while there's a (audio) cd in the cdrom-drive.

2004-10-21 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* configure.in: modernized use of AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE a bit (according to 
	http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Public-macros.html#Public%20macros)

2004-10-21 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* src/Dialog_Partition_New.cc: changed width of optionmenus from 150 to 160 pixels. (in certain langs the strings didn't fit)
	* src/VBox_VisualDisk.cc: used/unused legend doesn't have to show up if there's only linux-swap. 

2004-10-17 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* src/Dialog_About.cc (Show_Credits): Fixed Gtk-Warning with unknown pango markup and placed a 5 pixel-border around 
	translators credits.

2004-10-16 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>
	
	* src/Device.cc: when the libary of an optional filesystem (atm only reiserfs) wasn't installed, every scan printed an error 
	in the console (df couldn't find the partition listed). Fixed by checking if partition is busy before using df.

2004-10-16 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>
	
	* src/Dialog_Progress.cc: changed dialogwidth from 500 to 600 pixels. (icw certain languages the operation didn't fit)

2004-10-16 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* include/Win_GParted.h,
	  src/Win_GParted.cc: First load gui and then scan devices, this resulted in way faster startup and is more satisfactory (imho)
	  Also did some minor code cleanups and rearranged some functions needed for applying operations.
	* src/Dialog_Progress.cc: few minor code cleanups.

2004-10-14 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* include/Operation.h,
	  src/Operation.h: minor (code) change in displaying errormessage. Made Apply_Resize_Move_Extended_To_Visual() a bit more
	  readable (and thus debugable). This whole class could still use a soft, caring hand though :P
	* src/Device.cc: Unallocate space < 1MB wasn't filtered out. fixed.
	* src/Partition.cc (Set_Used): Unused wasn't set properly. fixed. 

2004-10-11 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* src/Win_GParted.cc: i just can't stop tweaking the operationslist =)

2004-10-11 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* src/Device.cc (Read_Disk_Layout): logic unallocated space wasn't read correctly, fixed.
	* include/Win_GParted.h: added open_operationslist() and menu_view_operations() .
	* src/Win_GParted.cc: tweaked operationlist behaviour a bit. Also added 'Operations" toggle-item to View menu.

	* implemented mk_label wherever possible (means less code, improved readability)

2004-10-06  David Lodge <dave@cirt.net>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added "en_GB" (British English).

2004-10-06 Bart Hakvoort  <gparted@users.sf.net>

	* lots of files =) : enabled support for reiserfs, also made filesystemsupport more 'pluggable' so it's easier to
	add support for other filesystems in the future.

	* removed all stringstreams from the project (they were possibly responsible for rare chrashes in certain locales)
	Note that i left 1 in include/Partition.h, this one is needed for int-->string conversions and won't pose a thread.

**changes**
- replaced some 'dunglish' terms with more decent english. (Thanks to Tino Meinen)
- cleaned up autoconf stuff a bit
- gparted now gets installed in the sbin/ instead of bin/ (1023181)
- maximum amount of primary partition isn't static anymore, it gets asked from the partition table.
- lots of internal code cleanups. this improved performance and stability.
- doubleclick now invokes infodialog
- added .desktop file so gparted is accessible from Gnome/Kde menus (thanks to Stephane LOEUILLET, 1023176)

**fixes**
- sometimes creating new fat filesystems in very small spaces resulted in errors. fixed.
- use copies from buildfiles instead of symlinks to them. (Thanks to Kristof Vansant)
- when performing operations on just copied partitions, there was a chance the operation would be executed on another partition. fixed.
- fixed a rare bug that caused incorrect partitiontable display after an operation went wrong.
- some errormessages were not entirely threadsafe, fixed (hopefully :P )
- fixed annoying bug with warningdialog which pops up after performing an operation on a busy device

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
